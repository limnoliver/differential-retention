# This script creates figures for differential retention project

# Figure 1: N and P retention according to Vollenweider & Harrison
# Figure 2: Differential retention according to V & H
# Figure 3: Differential retention with realistic depth and residence time
# plotted on figure - deciles from mass balance lakes?
# Figure 4: Mass balance lakes - depth vs residence time
# Figure 5: Mass balance lakes - histograms of N and P retention
# Figure 5.123: histograms of broken up by N retention > P retention,
# histogram of size, input concentrations, etc.
# Figure 6: N vs P retention
# Figure 7: Differential retention with deciles for depth and retention time + 
# real N and P retention
# Figure 8: Differential retention as % change in TN:TP vs rank or res time
# - predicted from models
# Figure 9: Differential retention as % change in TN:TP vs rank or res time
# - observed
# Figure 10: Same as Figure 9, but with color = rank or res time and x = start concentration
# figure 11: Same as figure 9, but broken up into 3 - each panel represents low, medium
# high res time/rank, and x = start ratio or start P concentration (to test Finlay hypothesis?)
# Figure 12: calculate Vf and sedimentation coefficient and summarize by lake type. 
# show how sed coef or Vf changes with nutrient input concentration
